Our applications are provided as Ad-Supported services and are intended for use "AS IS".</p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Our Applications do not gather precise GPS location information about your mobile device.</p>
            
            <p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions related to our applications.</p>
            
            <p>For a better experience while using our Applications, the Service Provider may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Applications and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that our Applications utilize third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by our Applications:</p>
