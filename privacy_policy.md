## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

## Third Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect usage and maintenance of this information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
